# Variations on a Theme of Qaganini

## Problem

## Approach

## Implementation of Composer and CLI

`music.py` contains the code for the `Composer` class, which creates circuits and runs jobs to generate music, and the `Sandbox_CLI` class, which produces the Command Line Interface that the user interacts with.

`playsound.py` contains a function `write_to_midi` that turns the circuits' output (a list of 8-bit binary strings) into MIDI files and a function `play_notes` that plays a MIDI file out loud.

## Generating Music of a Given Genre

`learning.py` and `classifygenre.py`

Download the GTZAN dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification. Move the folder called `Data` into your working directory.
