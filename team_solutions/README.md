# iQuHack2023-QOrdiggers
The QOrdiggers solution to the IonQ iQuHack2023 challenge

Also, we will especially thank Ryan Marcus for his Vector Field visualizations of Perlin Noise. He created a rust packaged that we have used to create the computer generated drawing for high qubit numbers. 

Instructions on running code in ColorConversion.ipynb: 

To run the Perlin Evolution code, you have must the rust progarmming language on your system. Compile the perlin noise generator with the following commands in the terminal. 

cd perlin-master

cargo build

cd ..
